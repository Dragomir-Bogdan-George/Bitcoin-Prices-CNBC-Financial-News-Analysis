This project represents a research on whether the prices of Bitcoin have been influenced by the financial market news. This project is the final project proposed for the course Data Wrangling at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. All mentioned authors in the report contributed equally.

The report contains all the extended information about the processes involved in determining the relationship between those two entities. One may read the document while browsing the code at the same time for a better understanding of it.

The jupyter notebook contains all the code that was written to analyse and reach a potential answer to the research question aformentioned in the report. Operations such as reading and cleaning the data, creating another data set, data merging and processing, but also sentiment analysis were conducted. Each news was attributed one sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), thus draw possible expected conclusions, such as the price of Bitcoin should increase, considering a positive news.

The two CSV files represent the data used in the project:
- BTC-USD-Prices.csv contains the data about the prices of Bitcoin, converted to USD between 2014-2023 (up and including the day when the project was finished)
- cnbc_news_dataset.csv contains the data about the news from the previously mentioned website, for example titles, authors etc.

For a more detailed description of the project, the report is the most suitable way to delve further.
